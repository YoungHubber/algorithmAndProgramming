Exercise 01
-----------

A "producer" file includes a line for each car manufacturer with the
following format:
manufactuiredName id
where manufacturerName and id are strings of 20 characters at most.
The following is a correct example:

FIAT it001
ALFA_ROMEO it002
BMW ge001
MERCEDES ge002
TOYOTA ja001
...

The size of the file, and the order of the lines within the file, are
unknown.

A "product" file stores the product names and relative prices for each
product of each manufacturer, with the format:
id productName price
The following one is a correct example:

it001 500 15131
it001 Panda 12001
it001 Punto 17891
ge002 AClass 22411
ge002 CClass 75641
...

The size (and order) of the file is unknown.

Write a C program that:
* receives two file names on the command line
* stores the content of the two files (the first one of type "producer",
  the second one of type "product") in a proper data structure
* goes through an iteration in which it reads the name of a
  manufacturer (e.g, FIAT) and it prints-out all products (and
  relative prices) produced by it on standard output.

Suggestion
----------

Implement a "list of lists", i.e., a main "producer" list with
a secondary "product" list for each producer element.

 ------	   ------    ------	 	 
 |    | -> |    | -> |    | -> ... product list
 ------    ------    ------   
   |
   v
 ------    ------	 
 |    | -> |    | -> ...
 ------	   ------   
   |
   v
producer
 list
 ...

as with this data structure it is easy to find all products
manufactured by a given producer.



Exercise 02 (A-G)
-----------------

Write the following recursive C functions:

A.
Function
res = mult (x, y);
to multiply two integer numbers x and y, and to return the result
res.

Notice that the elementary algorithm to perform multiplication is
based on a sum-and-shift process.
Anyway, mult may adopt the following recursive definition:
x * y = x * (y-1)
x * 1 = x

B.
Function
void d2b (int d, int *b, int *n);
to convert the decimal number d, into a binary one (stored into the
array b) with n bits.
Notice that to perform this conversion, it is necessary to
apply the "division" algorithm as follows:

   :2
23 | 
11 | 1
 5 | 1
 2 | 1
 1 | 0
 0 | 1

such that:
23 (base 10) = 10111 (base 2)
Suppose that the size of the binary array is always sufficient to
store all binary digits.

C.
Function
int catalan (int n);
to compute and to return the Catalan number of order n.

Catalan numbers are a sequence of numbers which can be defined
directly or recursively.
The recursive definition is the following one:

C_0 = 1     for n=0
and
C_{n} = sum_{i=0}^{i=(n-1)} (C_i * C_{n-1-i})     for n>=1

Write a program that, using a recursive function to generate Catalan numbers,
prints out the first 10 Catalan numbers.

Observation
-----------
sum indicates the summation symbol, i.e.,
sum_{i=0}^{i=(n-1)} (C_i * C_{n-1-i})
indicates the addition sequence of the numbers (C_i * C_{n-1-i})
for all values of i from i=0 to i=n-1:

C_0 = 1
C_1 = C_0*C_0 = 1
C_2 = C_0*C_1 + C_1*C_0 = 2
C_3 = C_0*C_2 + C_1*C_1 + C_2*C_0 = 5
C_4 = C_0*C_3 + C_1*C_2 + C_2*C_1 + C_3*C_0 = 14
C_5 = C_0*C_4 + C_1*C_3 + C_2*C_2 + C_3*C_1 + C_4*C_0 = 42
C_6 = C_0*C_5 + C_1*C_4 + C_2*C_3 + C_3*C_2 + C_4*C_1 + C_5*C_0 = 132
...

D.
Function
int countSpaces (char *s);
which counts and returns the number of white-space characters that
appear in a string s.
Notice that, characters are white-space as defined by the isspace()
function within the ctype library.

Observation
-----------
If a string str is read with command
scanf ("%d", str);
it cannot includes spaces as the reading operation actually stops when
it reaches a space.
Use the function gets to read a string with spaces, or define and
initialize the string as:
char str[] = "This is a string with spaces!";

E.
Function
int isPalindrome (char *s, int l); 
that takes a string s and its length l as arguments and recursively
determines whether the string is palindrome.

Observation
-----------
A sequence is palindrome when the sequence of characters or numbers
looks the same forwards and backwards.
For example the strings
Madam, I'm Adam
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
are palindrome (excluding spaces and commas and considering capital
equal to small letters), because they are spelled the same way reading
them from front to back or from back to front.
The number 12321 is a numerical palindrome.

F.
Function
void triangle (int n, ...); 
that given and integer value n (and any other parameters considered as
necessary) prints-out a triangle containing increasing integer
numbers.
For example, for n=4, the program has to print-out

1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4

Suggestion
----------

Use an iterative construct (along each row) plus a recursion mechanism
to move on the subsequent row.

G.
Implement the previous function
void triangle (int n, ...); 
without using any iterative construct, i.e., using recursion
to "move" along both rows and columns of the triangle.
