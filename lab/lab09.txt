Laboratory number 09

Exercise 01
-----------

A file includes a labyrinth with the following specifications:
- the first line of the file specifies the number of row R and the
  number of columns C of a matrix
- the following R lines specify the matrix rows (each one with C
  characters), where each
  - '@' indicates the initial position of a human being
  - ' ' represents corridors (empty cells)
  - '*' represents walls (full cells)
  - '#' represents exit points.
Supposed only one person is present in the maze in the initial
configuration.

The following is a correct example of such a maze:

12 10
**********
*        *
*   **@* *
* * ** * *
* ****** *
*   **   *
* *    ***
* ** * *** 
* *  * * *
* * ** * *
*   **   *
******#***

Write three recursive functions to find:
- one escape path
- all escape paths
- the shortest escape path
from the maze.
Print out the solution (or all solutions) on standard output.

Observation
-----------

To avoid extremely long running times, check the program on small
mazes or on mazes on which the number (and length) of escaping
paths is limited.



Exercise 02
-----------

The directory
lab09Library
includes two stack libraries:
- The first one (impl1) implemented on a dynamic array.
- The second one (impl2) implemented on a dynamic list.

Both of them include the following files:
- client.c
  the client using the stack
- stack.c, stackPublic.h, stackPrivate.h
  implementing all main stack functions (push, pop, etc.)
- item-int.c, item-string.c, item-struct.c
  and corresponding *.h files
  implementing the data type (i.e., enabling a stack on integer,
  string and structure items)
- util.c, util.h
  implementing a few library functions (such as malloc, free, etc.).

Perform the following operations:
- Select one of the two packages (the implementation on the dynamic
  array or on the dynamic list)
- Create a project in the Code-Block environment, "enabling" the stack
  with C structure elements
- Build the application, run to run it, understand it, and check if it
  runs correctly
- Add one more feature into the menu, which displays the
  content of the stack structure in FIFO order.
  Use a recursive function to visit either the array or the list.

Elective (optional)
-------------------

Add the same feature to the other version of the application (i.e.,
the one implemented on a list or array).
