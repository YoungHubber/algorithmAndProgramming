Exercise 01
-----------

A first file stores a text with an undefined number of rows.
Each row contains at most 100 characters.

A second file stores a list of words.
Each word is shorter than 20 characters and the file stores at most
100 (different) words.

The program has count the number of times each word stored in the
second file appears in the text stored in the first file.

Once the files have been read and manipulated, the program has to
print out (on standard output) each word found in the first file with
its absolute frequency, i.e., the number of times it appears in the
text.

Capital and small letter have to be considered as equivalent, e.g.,
"word" and "WORD" and "WoRd" must be considered as equivalent.

Example
-------

Let the following one be the first file:

Watch your thoughts ; they become words .
Watch your words ; they become actions .
Watch your actions ; they become habits .
Watch your habits ; they become character .
Watch your character ; it becomes your destiny .
Lao-Tze

and the following one the second one :

watch
words
become

The program has to print-out:

watch - 5 occurrence(s)
words - 2 occurrence(s)
become - 4 occurrence(s)



Exercise 02
-----------

A file defines a set of rectangles with the following format:
* Each row of the file contains 1 string and 2 real numbers:
  - The string (4 character long) is the rectangle identifier,
  - The two numbers specifies the x and y coordinates,
    respectively, of one of its vertices
* For each rectangle there are two lines in the file, specifying
  the coordinate of two opposite vertices (top-right and
  bottom-left or top-left and bottom-right).
  Notice that, in general, the two rows defining a rectangle are
  not consecutive, and that it is not known which vertex they
  specify.
The number lines in the file is at most equal to 100.

A C program receives 3 file names on the command line:
- The first file is an input file, and it contains all rectangles
  specifications as previously indicated
- The second file is an output file, and it must contain the
  name of the rectangles ordered by ascending area values.
- The third file is an output file, and it must contain the
  name of the rectangles ordered by ascending perimeter values.

Example
-------

Let the program be run with the following three parameters on the
command line
:
fileIn.txt fileArea.txt filePerimeter.txt

Moreover, let us suppose that the content of file fileIn.txt is the
following:

10
rct2  1.5 3.5
xxyy  -0.5 3.0
xxyy  1.5 2.0
abcd  1.0 4.5
ktkr  -2.5 1.5
abcd  2.0 2.0
rct2  3.5 -2.0
trya  2.5 -1.0
ktkr  1.5 3.5
trya  4.0 4.0

As areas and perimeters of the rectangles are:
rct2   area=11.00   perimeter=15.00
xxyy   area= 2.00   perimeter= 6.00
abcd   area= 2.50   perimeter= 7.00
ktkr   area= 8.00   perimeter=12.00
trya   area= 7.50   perimeter=13.00
the program has to generate the following two files:

fileArea.txt:
rct2
ktkr
trya
abcd
xxyy

filePerimeter.txt:
rct2
trya
ktkr
abcd
xxyy
